Evie was a worker [[Bees|bee]] of the [[Hive|placeholder]] Hive, serving as a member of the hives [[Royal Guard]] who fought valiantly to protect her [[Queen Bee]]. She loved her Family, making sure everyone was okay constantly. Evie Served for most of her life, before she one day started to notice some [[Natural Evolution|changes]].

Soon, the honey she produced started to taste different, but had no adverse effects on the bees otherwise. Like Evie, most of the hive also experienced these changes, and welcomed them as a part of their lives. 

The average lifespan of the hive improved, and they grew immensely in size, forcing them to grow the hive. 

One day, as Evie was slow to evolve herself, she was resting a while to try and grow some more. While she was asleep, [[Mona's Backstory|something terrible]] happened to her hive and family, and she was left as the only survivor of her hive. Evie, devastated, fell into a depression, and was eventually taken away by researcher [[Mona|Desdemona]] in her vulnerable state. 

Mona subjected Evie to [[Artificial Evolution|clinical trials]], where she forced Evie to evolve faster than natural. Eventually, Evie developed speech and conversed with Mona, seeing her as a trusted figure due to her being unaware of Mona's actions against her hive. Mona seemed to reciprocate these feelings for Evie, growing attached. But she knew what had to be done.

One day, Evie had a gap in her memory, and eventually woke up to find Mona, mortally wounded, laying in a pool of blood gushing from a gash in her side. Evie desperately tried to save Mona, before the researcher whispered weakly "Have... my... body... little bee..."

After this, Evie woke up as her current self; her body now a fusion of Mona and her Apidian body, carrying Mona's scar tissue from her fatal wound as a permanent mark of her past. She remembers the events as the following:

- She left her hive one day after growing too large to live there anymore.
- She travelled for a while, searching for things to do.
- She found a strange woman, and was out cold for a while after meeting her.

This "fake memory", has thus proven to be quite a challenge for the Apideus, inducing headaches in her whenever she questions its legitimacy.

Mona's soul now lives on in Evie's body, serving as her guide and mentor on her journey to face her past.
