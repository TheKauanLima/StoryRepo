Doctor Desdemona, known by most as just "Mona", was the head researcher for the [[Kingdom|Placeholder]] Kingdom, serving as the main overseer of all scientific studies in the kingdom, even claiming the title of Doctor due to her accomplishments. Mona was incredibly intelligent and even physically capable, regularly honing her skills with polearms as a means of equipping herself in case of battle.

Mona, analytic in nature, lacked a lot of emotional intelligence and empathy, making her studies occasionally cruel and unethical in the name of science. This also left her with few people she truly connected with, often leaving her alone with her own thoughts.

However, there was one soul that Mona grew attached to: Queen Vanessa of [[Kingdom|Placeholder]]. The two grew closer by the day, creating precious memories that stick with Mona to this day. Eventually, Mona proposed to the queen, and the two became lovers, making a vow to love each other for the rest of their days. 

Unfortunately, however, Queen Vanessa soon succumbed to foodborne illness caused by consumption of honey from Anthrapis, a human-bee hybrid race as a product of genetic diversity during evolution and excessive human interaction. The kingdom worshipped bees, even as a superior race on occasions, and so it was natural that the queen consumed a lot of honey in her time. This unfortunately led to the incident the resulted in her demise. During her final days, Mona swore to her that she would bring her back so that she may never leave her side again.

Vanessa, having bore no children, made a dying request to crown her lover as the next queen.

The coronation was one of agony to Mona; she felt that the kingdom moved past the queens death too quickly, and she herself was still deeply grieving.

After her passing, Queen Mona performed an autopsy on her, revealing the truth about her death. 
Learning this truth, Mona tracked down the Anthrapian hive that she deemed responsible and brutalized it, reducing it to nothing but wax and wing membrane. However, after her grief fuelled rampage, Mona realised that she had made a grave mistake. 

Being the scientist she was, she understood that due to the physiology of Anthrapis, it would be possible to transfer the cognition from a human body to an Anthrapian host. 
Desperate to see her lover once more, she sifts through the hive, looking for any sign of life. Eventually, she came across Evie, a slower developing Anthrapi that survived the brutal onslaught of the mourning researcher. The bee, terrified, showed no resistance as she was taken away from her ruined home. 

The new Queen, now determined to bring back her lover using the body of the soon-to-be Anthrapi, performed countless experiments on her, trying to accelerate her growth as fast as possible out of fear of being too late to save her queen. Eventually, the Anthrapi-turned-Apideus developed speech, and conversed with Mona. She spoke of stories from her time in the hive, and the culture surrounding it. This led to Mona growing attached to the bee, motivating her to build an alternative solution for Evie to live her life should the experiment go wrong.

The residents of the kingdom took notice, and eventually figured out the truth about her experiments on Evie. Outraged by the sacrilegious acts against the creatures they care for so much, plotted to overthrow Queen Mona. 
But the queen did not care; she had one goal. 

During the final day of her experiments, Mona prepared to transfer the cognition from her lover to the body of the near-complete Apideus. However, the citizens of the kingdom had other plans. 
During the transfer, the people of [placeholder] stormed Mona's laboratory, destroying all work that Mona had done in her lifetime; this included the cognition transferal device that Evie was currently inside. This left Evie's memory partially fragmented and decayed, and prevented Vanessa's cognition from entering her body.

This sent Mona into a state of anguish, causing her to lash out against her people carelessly. She grabbed Evie from the machine, her failsafe, and her war pike from the wall and spilt the blood of many of her people. She was reckless, swinging her polearm madly, crazed by her perceived failure for her late lover. This carelessness led to her being struck down and impaled through her stomach by her own weapon, stolen by a [[Sus man|suspicious townsfolk]]. Mona was then thrown out of the kingdom, along with her hidden belongings.

Evie, dazed from the failed procedure, fruitlessly attempted to stop Mona from passing, until the Doctor states "Have... my... body... little bee..." and deploys her failsafe.
This action fused the bodies of the two beings, creating a fully complete Apideus that now houses the souls of Evie and Mona together. 

*"Evie doesn't seem to remember what happened. She thinks her family is okay, she doesn't know that I took them away from her... I must never let her discover the truth. She must live her life happy, even if it means living a lie."*
