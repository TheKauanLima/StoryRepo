Modern? 
Evie comes from a monarchic kingdom

# Plot Idea 1
## Background
General Information:
 - Humanity discovered the anthrapians after an archeological team found an odd structure (The Hive) in "idk" place in the world (deep within some jungle)
 - Vanessa's mother, the old Queen, wanted to make peace with this seemingly alien tribe.

## Random Ideas
- All anthrapians are actually artificial, but that history has been lost to time and is not uncovered when anthrapian and human societies make contact.
- Baby anthrapians are no more than bee-sized and are tasked with collecting honey.
- Anthrapian lifespans are much longer than that of a normal bee's, but still shorter than that of a human's.
- Honey is used to feed the baby anthrapian population and aid in their growth.
- Apidian honey has incredible healing properties when properly treated **(Evie, but i cant think of why Evie is different)**
## Basic Idea
- As trade becomes more prevalent, honey is harder to come by for growth, so older anthrapian kids are given less honey to provide for the weaker and smaller babies, this causes stunted development upon many (Evie included)
- Anthrapian queen must also birth less children because of this, which displeases her, so she wants to cut off communication with the humans after a few short years.
- Humans dislike this sudden cut in their honey supply, which was different from normal bee honey, more addictive and drug-like.
- Humans fund research for artificial bee production, which goes unnoticed by the anthrapians for a while until "runts" in their society become more prevalent, clear that genetic tampering had been done.
- The foodborne illness spreads as a result of the honey collected but processed poorly by the artificial bees which is harmful to humans and not viable for bee growth, so conflict emerges as the anthrapians believe humans overstepped their bounds.
- The illness claims the life of many, including Queen Vanessa
- Vanessa had no offspring, so the throne went to her lover, Mona.
- Mona found out that the foodborne illness was the cause of her lovers death and declared war on anthrapians, thinking that it was their doing (she doesnt know about the artificial).
