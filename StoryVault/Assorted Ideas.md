Modern? 
Evie comes from a monarchic kingdom

# Plot Idea 1
## Background
General Information:
 - Humanity discovered the anthrapians after an archeological team found an odd structure (The Hive) in "idk" place in the world (deep within some jungle)
 - Vanessa's mother, the old Queen, wanted to make peace with this seemingly alien tribe.

## Random Ideas
- All anthrapians are actually artificial, but that history has been lost to time and is not uncovered when anthrapian and human societies make contact.
- Baby anthrapians are no more than bee-sized and are tasked with collecting honey.
- Anthrapian lifespans are much longer than that of a normal bee's, but still shorter than that of a human's.
- Honey is used to feed the baby anthrapian population and aid in their growth.
- Apidian honey has incredible healing properties when properly treated **(Evie, but i cant think of why Evie is different)**
## Basic Idea
- As trade becomes more prevalent, honey is harder to come by for growth, so older anthrapian kids are given less honey to provide for the weaker and smaller babies, this causes stunted development upon many (Evie included)
- Anthrapian queen must also birth less children because of this, which displeases her, so she wants to cut off communication with the humans after a few short years.
- Humans dislike this sudden cut in their honey supply, which was different from normal bee honey, more addictive and drug-like.
- Humans fund research for artificial bee production, which goes unnoticed by the anthrapians for a while until "runts" in their society become more prevalent, clear that genetic tampering had been done.
- The foodborne illness spreads as a result of the honey collected but processed poorly by the artificial bees which is harmful to humans and not viable for bee growth, so conflict emerges as the anthrapians believe humans overstepped their bounds.
- The illness claims the life of many, including Queen Vanessa
- Vanessa had no offspring, so the throne went to her lover, Mona.
- Mona found out that the foodborne illness was the cause of her lovers death and declared war on anthrapians, thinking that it was their doing (she doesnt know about the artificial).

## MORE IDEA
- Evie is different to most Apideus. Most of them look like homunculi, due to being a product of Human cells combining with Anthrapian cells and then being left to grow. Evie, however, is a result of being taken from the hive and injected with human cells, only to fully fuse with Mona later. Evie looks more human due to a full merge occurring.
- Apideus are a project created by humanity after the demand for honey grows too much. Humanity wanted more honey, so they started the project.
  Many studies were done by combining human and anthrapian cells, but there was one paper that called for a merging of a human and an anthrapian. This is the only known method of creating a "true" Apideus. 
- True Apideus were less favoured as a method, due to the need of sacrificing an anthrapian and a human life.
- The project was funded by queen Vanessa, as she was tired of the lack of honey and having to rely on such "worthless creatures". She was never fond of her mothers choices, but she found that she may be able to exploit the peace she made with Anthrapians. She funded the project and ordered the production of honey in less than a month. After rushing the project, many Apideus came out as horribly disfigured due to the conditions they were grown in. 
- These Apideus produced toxic honey that was first tasted by queen Vanessa, who said it was "Good enough." and ordered widespread deployment of the product.
- This toxic manufactured honey took the lives of many, including the queen herself.
- Mona was unaware of this project and so when she took the throne she blamed the bees for this and started a war. It is only after this that she finds out about Apideus. She never finds out Vanessas involvement (until maybe a future arc?)
- She found the paper on true apideus and wanted to  create one to bring back her queen. She did not know how horrible of a person vanessa was.
