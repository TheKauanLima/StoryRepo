# Pre-Story Lore (Chronological)
- Hive was found.
- Humans and the hive traded
- A brief period in which trade was prevalent occurs, lead by the old queen. (Bees give humans honey, humans give bees knowledge)
- Honey is normal for bees, but said to be miraculous for humans.
- The old queen shortly thereafter dies, and the new Queen Vanessa now rules.
- Humans start developing heightened senses after eating the honey, causing them to want more.
- The hive becomes more developed, but humans become greedier, asking for more honey over time, more than the hive can reasonably give.
- The queen bee, angered, shuts off outside communications, and decides to once again become isolationist.
- Humans, now short of honey, suddenly experience mass withdrawal from the honey, especially the nobles and elites, who had more access to honey in their foods, now becoming staples in their diets.
- The nobility falls ill without their supply and form a scientific endeavor to recreate the honey scientifically.
- Workers and drones from the hive get kidnapped in secret by human forces and then experimented on to extract DNA and create artificial bees genetically different from those in the hive, but able to as a result produce more honey.
- Hive production exceled again, and after much deliberation, the queen thought it in the Hive's best interests to resume trade with the human's to further their hive's progress, as their life with trade was safer and more prosperous.
- The honey made by apideus however was diluted, and since these were bees now not made with the proper biology, the honey over time as the queen ate it and began birthing more children, weaker from the lacking honey, a more prevalent problem began to occur as now the honey reserves were polluted with "impure" honey.
- The impure honey had weakening effects on any bee which consumed it, not allowing them to live to their full potential and become physically weaker. This impure honey also had destructive effects on the human population.
- Soon, the human population began to suffer as people received adverse effects from the new foodborne illness spread by the honey. Queen Vanessa most affected by this. Having already been severely weakened by the lack of honey, this new illness was enough to kill her.
- The human plan backfired and now many were dying, but for the general population, this was seen as an attack by the bees, and anger ensued.
- The queenless kingdom needed a new leader, and Mona was appointed as the temporary replacement as she was the Queen's lover. Though Mona was just a scientist and not fit to rule, the Monarchy needed a temporary solution while the bee plague spread.
- Separate from the actions of the kingdom, the Anthrapians singled out the Apideus and segregated their societies, leaving the old and impure hive to create another far away from the humans and troublesome bees. The Apideus were left sickly with their fallen hive.
- All hope was not lost as there was a special task provided on some of the Anthrapians to care for the Apideus to get them stronger, but they had not known how deep their alterations had affected them and that the Apideus would not be able to become normal ever, causing a rift between the populations which led to the mistreatment of their kind even amongst those who were meant to treat them.
- Evie was part of this force to help guide the Apideus, but as human anger rose, it eventually lead to the mass extermination of the hive and its foul honey by orders of the grieving Mona.
- Though most of the Anthrapians had long fled to away from the old hive, some were there while tending to the Apideus and were taken by the humans, specifically ordered by Mona for experimentation.
- At this point, Mona researches the bee specimen she took before the decimation of the hive, performing autopsies and several other unethical experiments on the Anthrapians and Apideus, until she got to Evie.
- Evie was subject to different experiments, based on a whim and a small lead she had from the honey's properties. She expected she would be able to form a link with Anthrapian minds through honey, and she needed pure samples from the pure-blooded Anthrapian, Evie.
- Thus Evie and Mona formed a sort of bond which was unexpected. Evie didn't know who she was or what she caused, but was promised to be reunited with her hive, though Mona was lying when she promised that.
- At the end of the experimentation, Mona had began to feel guilt for the hive as she realized that the downfall of the kingdom wasn't the hive's fault, but theirs.
- Mona tried to rectify this and tried to find ways to inform the public, but before she could, some nobles and scheming elites began to speak out about secret project to create more honey.
- This newfound outrage against the kingdom caused anti-monarchy sentiment against the old order, plummeting the kingdom into disarray.
- On Mona's final day, her lab was infiltrated by a group of adversarial nobles who killed her before she could finish her experiments.
- Some time after, Evie, finding Mona laying down was then able to absorb her soul, entirely changing her being to become something between Anthrapian and Apideus.
- Now, it is Evie's goal to find her hive and to reform the human kingdom on behalf of Mona's soul.

- kingdom B sees it beneficial to take over kingdom A in its honey production
- kingdom B sends one of their scientists, Mona, to kingdom A to conduct research on the bees
- Mona ends up falling in love with Queen Vanessa and begins to align herself more with kingdom A
- kingdom A prospers more due to Mona's scientific developments
- kingdom B, angered, decides to plan a war against kingdom A
- After the hive shuts off trade with kingdom A and the diluted honey weakens the kingdom to the death of the queen, Mona takes action against the hive
- Mona takes the anthrapian caregivers from the destroyed hive and retreats to her distant labs to conduct experiments (Possibly to try and convince kingdom B to let her live through her knowledge of the honey)
- Nobles from kingdom B find her and her lab and kill her anyway, at which point the bond she forms with Evie she realizes is more real than any ties to kingdom B she ever had
- As a final act, she binds herself to Evie
